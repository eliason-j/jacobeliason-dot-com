#### I am a data analyst with experience in data visualization, statistical modeling, and survey research.

I graduated in 2019 with a B.S. in statistical science from Brigham Young University with minors in political science and mathematics. While in school, I worked on sports analytics and international development projects as a research assistant in the statistics and political science departments respectively. 

I spent a year doing survey research at [Y2 Analytics](https://y2analytics.com/) before moving East during the pandemic to start a new position at the Census Bureau. I currently do production work and research for the [Survey of Income and Program Participation](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp/about.html).

I enjoy running, cycling, and film photography.
